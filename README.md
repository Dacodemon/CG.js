# CG.js version 1
This is my free JavaScript Library
This library will make it easier to draw javascript graphic pages! You can use multiple canvases at a time, however you will need to have an id for each one this will be how you will be able to draw on them. This library also consists of dom functions also. You can add divs,script tags, h tags, and p tags.
